I am currently a PhD candidate at Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I received my Bachelor's degree from Peking University in 2018 and my Master's degree from Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2021, supervised by [Prof. Jizhong Han](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~hjz). I was also co-supervised by [Prof. Si Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-QtVtNEAAAAJ) leading the [ColaLab](https://www.colalab.net/) at Beihang University from 2018 to now. I have published more than 15 papers in cutting-edge international conferences and journals, including TPAMI, TIP, CVPR, ECCV, ACM MM, etc. I have been awarded the Excellent Prize of President Scholarship for Postgraduate Students of Chinese Academy of Sciences and the China National Scholarship in 2020. I have worked as a research intern at SenseTime and Meituan, and have been a reviewer for top conferences and journals. My research interest includes autonomous driving and multimedia analysis, focusing on multimodal visual segmentation and detection.
