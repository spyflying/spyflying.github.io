<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I will join University of Macau as a Postdoctoral Researcher in October 2025, working with [Prof. Zhedong Zheng](https://www.zdzheng.xyz/). I received my Bachelor's degree from Peking University in 2018, and my Master's degree and PhD's degree from Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2021 and 2025, supervised by [Prof. Jizhong Han](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~hjz). I was also co-supervised by [Prof. Si Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-QtVtNEAAAAJ) leading the [ColaLab](https://www.colalab.net/) at Beihang University from 2018 to now. I have published more than 15 papers in cutting-edge international conferences and journals, including TPAMI, TIP, CVPR, ECCV, ACM MM, etc. I have been awarded the Excellent Prize of President Scholarship for Postgraduate Students of Chinese Academy of Sciences and the China National Scholarship in 2020. I have worked as a research intern at SenseTime and Meituan, and have been a reviewer for top conferences and journals. My research interest includes autonomous driving and multimedia analysis, focusing on multimodal visual segmentation and detection.
